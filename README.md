Question 1. Consider the following label of arrival time and burst time for four processes P1,P2,P3,P4 and given Time Quantum = 2.
Need to calculate the below times in Round Robin algorithm using a program. Need to write the pseudo code.
Completion Time : Time at which process completes its execution
Turn Around Time : Time difference between completion time and arrival time
Turn Around Time: Completion time - Arrival Time
Waiting Time : Time difference between turn around time and burst time.
Waiting Time : Turn Around Time - Burst Time
Process = P1,P2,P3,P4
Burst Time(execution time) = 5 ms, 4 ms, 2 ms, 1 ms
Arrival time = 0 ms, 1 ms, 2 ms, 4 ms

Question 2. Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap raining.

Example :

(1) Input: arr[] = [2,0,2]
Output: 2

(2) Input: arr[] = { 3,0,2,0,7}
output : 7

Question 3. Write a java program where user given an array arr[ ] of positive numbers, the task is to find the maximum sum of a subsequence with constraint that 2 numbers int sequence should not be adjacent in the array.

Example :

(1) Input: arr[] = { 5,5,10,100,10,5}
output : 110

(2) Input: arr[] = { 3,2,7,10}
output : 13

Question 4. Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. Write the program in java.

Input: Linked list 1->2->3->4->NULL

Output: Linked list should be changed to
4->3->2->1->NULL

Question 5. Write a java program where user given the input and given array A[] of n numbers and another number x, determines whether or not there exist two elements in A[] whose sum is exactly x.
